A little program to checks and create a necessary files and registry  values to launch SIT-Coop or SPT.AKI.

# How it works?
This checks for entries in the registry about the address "address" and, if missing, creates them. It also checks the presence and size of files: "EscapeFromTarkov.exe" and "EscapeFromTarkov_BE.exe" and the presence of the folder "BattleEye"
